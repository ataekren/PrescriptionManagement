# Prescription Management System

A modern, microservices-based prescription management system designed to streamline the process of managing medical prescriptions, connecting patients, doctors, and pharmacies.

## Project Overview

The Prescription Management System is a comprehensive solution built using .NET microservices architecture with a modern frontend. The system facilitates secure prescription handling, user authentication, and seamless communication between healthcare providers and patients.

## Architecture

The system follows a microservices architecture pattern with the following components:

### Backend Services

- **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication, authorization, and user management
- **Medicine Service**: Manages medicine catalog, inventory, and medicine-related operations
- **Prescription Service**: Handles prescription creation, management, and tracking

### Frontend
- Modern web application built with Next.js
- Responsive design for optimal user experience

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: 
  - .NET Core
  - Microservices Architecture
  - Docker Containerization
  - Entity Framework Core
  
- **Frontend**:
