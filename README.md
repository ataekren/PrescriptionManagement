# Prescription Management System

A modern, microservices-based prescription management system designed to streamline the process of managing medical prescriptions, connecting patients, doctors, and pharmacies.

## Project Overview

The Prescription Management System is a comprehensive solution built using .NET microservices architecture with a modern frontend. The system facilitates secure prescription handling, user authentication, and seamless communication between healthcare providers and patients.

## Architecture

The system follows a microservices architecture pattern with the following components:

### Backend Services
- **API Gateway**: Routes and manages requests to appropriate microservices
- **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication, authorization, and user management
- **Medicine Service**: Manages medicine catalog, inventory, and medicine-related operations
- **Prescription Service**: Handles prescription creation, management, and tracking

### Frontend
- Modern web application built with Next.js
- Responsive design for optimal user experience

## Design

### User Roles
The system implements two distinct user roles:

**Doctor**
- Add medicines to prescription list and issue prescriptions

**Pharmacist**
- Process prescriptions
- Update prescription status

### Security
- JWT-based authentication with configurable token expiration
- Role-based authorization
- Data encryption for sensitive information
- Secure API communication between services

### Key Entities
- **Users**
- **Prescriptions**
- **Medications**
- **Prescription Items**
- **Pharmacies**
- **Submissions**

### Use Cases

**Prescription Management**
- Doctors create and issue prescriptions
- Pharmacists process prescriptions
- System tracks prescription status

**Medicine Management**
- Sync medicine database with external source
- Track medicine inventory

**User Management**
- User registration and authentication
- Role-based access control
- Profile management
- Password recovery
